					<h3 class="mb-4">Low Fidelity Mockups</h3>
					<h4>Provider Profile</h4>

					<p>For the provider, I had a pretty good guess on the features that we would like to showcase. The only thing is which section of the profile would we need to stand out. I decided to make a traditional profile page with the profile picture and username on the right-hand side of the page. Below that the main idea was to show the main features for the buyers such as a messaging button, provider rating, and tagline. Skills were the next most obvious feature to show next. Everything else fell in line that we thought were the most important to have on the profile.</p>

				<div></div>
			
                <br></br> 
                <br></br>
                <h4>Messaging</h4>
                <p>While trying to design the messaging feature, I thought about the messaging applications that I enjoy to use. The two the came to mind were Slack and iMessage. I only had a week to design this feature so I had to Frankenstein something together. Features that I included were:</p>
                <ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
            
                    <li>The left-hand side of the page is a similar look to iMessage's contacts page. It also has the feature of bold text with a new message that has not been read yet.</li>
                    <li>The middle section has bubble text messages such as iMessage and the typing section of Slack.</li>
                    <li>The right side of the page. Slack has an attachment section that also uses threads. This is one of my favorite features of any messaging feature. It is a great way to easily see your attachments and other messages. </li>

						<h3 class="mb-4">High Fidelity Mockup - Candidate Listing</h3>
                        <p>The candidate listing is to show the available candiate's with a variety of filters and a search bar for any service with a location.</p>
                        <p>The idea is that you can find a certain candidate, purchase that candidate, and once you have done that, you will be able to unlock certain features such as their phone number, email, and resume. </p>
                        <p>I decided to make this page feel like an e-commerce page. find what you need and purchase quickly. I had the idea of having the cart with everyone familiar with that. That changed to having the cart become the briefcase. This way it would hopefully make the users feel like they were not shopping for a real human.</p>
                        <p>One feature that I had was to make sure the user did not have to leave the page to look at a user's profile. Once the candidate's card is clicked, you will be able to view that candidate's profile. You can expand that profile or close out of it.</p>
                        <!-- <ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
                            <li>The user name with location.</li>
                            <li>Description of the provider. </li>
                            <li>Buttons that would allow you to access the provider by viewing their profile or to send them a direct message.</li>
                            <li>Top two skill tags with an indication of how many more skills that you have.</li>
                            <li>Buyer reviews for transparency.</li>
                            <li>Average starting wage.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>I also thought of how the buyer would navigate through providers. I decided to add the appropriate filters while having the access to the services on the left side of the page.</p> -->

						<h3 class="mb-4">High Fidelity Mockup - Canidate Profile</h3>
                        <p>The candidate's profile is pretty similar to the Marketplace profile page. The main features that I wanted to stand out were: </p>
                        <ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
                            <li>Preferred salary.</li>

                        </ul>
                        <p>The prefered salary goes along with the transparency of the Qkly suite. It also allows the recruiter or hiring manager to have an idea of what the candidate is looking for salary-wise.</p>
                        <p>The ability to unlock the profile is critical for the user. Right now you can see that the profile is locked with the email, phone number, and personal portfolio being fuzzed out. Once you can to purchase that candidate, that blocker would not appear.</p>
                        <p>I also wanted to keep the same feel like all of the other user profiles on the Qkly suite. The only real noticeable difference is that the yearly timelines are highlighted and the skills and certificates are moved to the right side. I felt that the left side would have the most important information for that recruiter to see right away.</p>

                        <p>An automatic resume download would occur once you have purchased your selected candidates. </p>
                        <P>I like how you can choose which payment method you would like. This would set the platform apart from having to go back to your user's profile and having to set your account payment method.</P>

						<h3 class="mb-4">Revising</h3>
                        <p>The People platform is different in the fact that I believe that users have never really used or seen anything like this recruiting tool before. I did not have a ton of feedback just yet and the platform is fairly small. I did just have some minor issues:</p>

					<h3 class="mb-4">Overall Conclusion</h3>
                    <p>The People page is my first lead design project. This recruiting platform is unique in the fact that I haven't seen anything like this.</p>

                    <p>I just really wanted to design a platform that is fast and efficient.</p>
                    
                    <p>This platform is relatively new and does not have a ton of user feedback to go with it. It will be interesting to see what the future holds for this. I hope that I re-shaped how recruiters or hiring managers hire future employees.</p>
